      Welcome! My Story & The Heart Behind Trained Tails
    </h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-8">
    Hello and welcome to Trained Tails! I'm so thrilled you've stopped by. My name is [Your Name/Founder's Name - Placeholder], and I'm the passionate dog lover and training enthusiast behind this blog. My journey into the fascinating world of dog behavior and positive training started right here in beautiful Istanbul, and it's been an incredible adventure ever since. Trained Tails was born from a simple desire: to share effective, kind, and science-backed training methods to help dog owners build truly amazing, trusting relationships with their canine companions.

  <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-4 mt-12">My Journey to Positive Training</h3>

  <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-6">
    Like many people, my deep dive into dog training began with my own dogs. I faced challenges – recall struggles in bustling Istanbul parks, leash pulling on historical streets, the usual puppy antics! Initially, I explored various methods, but something didn't feel quite right with the more traditional, correction-based approaches. It wasn't fostering the partnership I craved.
  </p>
  <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-8">
    That led me down the path of positive reinforcement and science-based training. Discovering how dogs *really* learn, understanding their body language, and focusing on rewarding desired behaviors instead of punishing unwanted ones was revolutionary for me. It wasn't just more effective; it felt better, building communication and joy rather than conflict. Since then, I've dedicated myself to learning everything I can – constantly reading research, attending workshops [mention certifications if applicable, e.g., "earning my certification"], and working hands-on with dogs of all breeds and temperaments, including volunteering with some wonderful local Istanbul rescues. This experience solidified my belief that kindness and science are the keys to unlocking a dog's potential.
