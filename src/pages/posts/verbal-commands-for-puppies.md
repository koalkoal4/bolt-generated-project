<h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-6">Hello World! Starting Your Puppy's Word Training</h2>

<p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
    Bringing a new puppy home is pure chaos and joy, right? Among the house-training puddles and needle-sharp teeth, we're also eager to start teaching them how to guide our world. Verbal commands are a huge part of that communication bridge. I remember the first time my clumsy little fluffball seemed to understand his name – it felt like a huge victory! We were not expecting perfect obedience the very next day, just that first spark of connection.
</p>
<p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-8">
    Instructing your puppy in the meaning of words like "Sit," "Come," or "Stay" isn't merely a prelude to achieving some kind of obedience, and it certainly isn't about establishing a sort of my-way-or-the-highway control that some people believe is necessary for training any dog. Those things are, or at least should be, more or less incidental to the business of achieving a comfortable and reliable understanding between you and your puppy. Let's dive into how to get started with those first <a href="https://trainedtails.com/posts/basic-dog-training" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline">basic training</a> words.

<p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-4">
    Puppies are little learning sponges, but they also have the attention span of a gnat! You can start teaching simple words almost immediately, but remember:

            <strong class="font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100">Age Matters:</strong> Very young puppies (8-12 weeks) might only manage a minute or two of focused training.

<h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-6">How Puppies Learn Words: Pairing Sounds with Actions</h3>

<p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-8">
    Puppies don't magically understand English! We need to teach them that a specific sound (our verbal cue) predicts a specific action and often, a reward. The basic method involves pairing the word with the action as it's happening. Here’s how i break it down:
</p>

<div class="relative border-l-2 border-emerald-300 dark:border-emerald-700/50 ml-4 space-y-10 mb-12">
    <div class="relative pl-8">
        <div class="absolute w-8 h-8 bg-emerald-500 dark:bg-emerald-600 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center -left-4 ring-4 ring-white dark:ring-slate-900">
            <span class="font-bold text-white text-sm">1</span>
        </div>
        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-2">Get the Behavior First (Lure or Capture):</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
            You need the puppy to do the thing before you can label it. Luring: Use a tasty treat right by their nose to guide them into position (e.g., move the treat up and back over their head to lure a 'Sit'). Capturing: Catch them doing the behavior naturally (e.g., they sit on their own). Avoid common <a href="https://trainedtails.com/posts/beginner-mistakes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline">beginner mistakes</a> like pushing them into position.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="relative pl-8">
       <div class="absolute w-8 h-8 bg-emerald-500 dark:bg-emerald-600 rounded-full flex items-center justify-center -left-4 ring-4 ring-white dark:ring-slate-900">
            <span class="font-bold text-white text-sm">2</span>
       </div>
       <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-2">Add the Verbal Cue (As it Happens):</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
            Say the word ("Sit!") clearly and cheerfully once just as your puppy starts moving into the position (or as you start the lure). Don't say it before they know what it means! Maintain a <a href="https://trainedtails.com/posts/tone-of-voice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline">tone of voice</a> that is happy and encouraging.

       </div>
       <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-2">Mark the Moment & Reward Instantly:</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
            The instant your puppy's bum hits the floor for 'Sit', mark it with an enthusiastic "Yes!" (or a clicker sound if you're using one). Immediately follow with a tiny, super-tasty <a href="https://trainedtails.com/posts/treats-and-rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline">treat</a>. Timing is everything! A treat pouch from your <a href="https://trainedtails.com/posts/dog-training-tools-for-beginners" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline">beginner tool kit</a> helps immensely here.

       <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-2">Keep it SHORT, Frequent & Fun!</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
            Seriously, 1-3 minutes is plenty for one session. Stop before your puppy gets bored, distracted, or starts making mistakes. Aim for a few super short, successful sessions throughout the day rather than one long one. Avoid <a href="https://trainedtails.com/posts/avoiding-overtraining" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline">overtraining</a> at all costs!

       </div>
       <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-slate-800 dark:text-slate-100 mb-2">Fade the Lure (When Ready):</h4>
        <p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300">
            Once your puppy starts anticipating the action when they hear the word, begin to make your lure less obvious (e.g., use just the hand motion without the treat visible initially). The goal is for them to respond to the word itself. You might eventually <a href="https://trainedtails.com/posts/treat-to-praise" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline">transition from treats to praise</a> or other rewards sometimes, but keep treats handy for puppies!

<p class="text-lg text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 mb-8">
    Introducing verbal commands is the start of a wonderful conversation with your puppy. It's less about instant obedience and more about building understanding, trust and a toolkit for navigating life together. Keep it positive, keep it short, keep it fun, and set realistic <a href="https://trainedtails.com/posts/training-goals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-emerald-600 dark:text-emerald-400 hover:underline">goals</a>.
